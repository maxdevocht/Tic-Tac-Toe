# Pure CSS Tic Tac Toe w/ SVG ðŸ•¹ #CodePenChallenge

I've been wanting to put together my own pure CSS tic tac toe for a little while. Seems like an opportunity to make use of `dd` and `dt` for describing the winner ðŸ˜…

I've seen other great implementations of pure CSS tic tac toe but for my own I wanted to make use of animation and CSS variables. SVG provides a nice touch for animating the naughts and crosses. CSS variables can be used to cut out some of the styling code and also produce random and dynamic animations.

Enjoy!
